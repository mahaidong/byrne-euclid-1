# byrne-euclid
A digitalization of Byrne's Euclid.

Byrne's Euclid is a graphical rendition of Euclid's Elements, using visuals instead of names in mathematical proofs. Besides its interesting didactic approach, the book is also appreciated for its absolutely beautiful typesetting and graphic design.

I started this project in 2013, motivated by two things. One, I thought it would be interesting to extend Byrne's intuitive approach even further by adding interactivity to the visualizations. Second, I was interested in exploring experimental multimedia features for modern web design (such as the use of the Processing language).

I left the project in the prototyping stage. And now that [Nicholas Rougeux's far superior effort](https://www.c82.net/euclid/) exists (check it out!), I'm quite sure I won't ever feel the need to resurrect this project.
