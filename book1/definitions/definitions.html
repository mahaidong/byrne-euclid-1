<h1>BOOK    I.</h1>
<h2>DEFINITIONS.</h2>

<p id="regular">
<ul>
<li>
I.<br>
A <em>point</em> is that which has no parts.
</li>

<li>
II.<br>
A <em>line</em> is length without breadth.
</li>

<li>
III.<br>
The extremities of a line are points.
</li>

<li>
IV.<br>
A straight or right line is that which lies evenly between its extremities.
</li>

<li>
V.<br>
A surface is that which has length and breadth only.
</li>

<li>
VI.<br>
The extremities of a surface are lines.
</li>

<li>
VII.<br>
A plane surface is that which lies evenly between its extremities.
</li>

<li>
VIII.<br>
A plane angle is the inclination of two lines to one another, in a plane,
which meet together, but are not in the same direction.
</li>

<li>
IX.<br>
A plane angle is the inclination of two lines to one another, which
meet straight together, but are not in the same straight line.
</li>

<li>
X.<br>
When one straight line standing on another straight line makes the adjacent
angles equal, each of these angles is called a <em>right angle</em>, and
each of these lines is said to be <em>perpendicular</em> to the other.
</li>

<li>
XI.<br>
An obtuse angle is an angle greater than a right angle.
</li>

<li>
XII.<br>
An acute angle is an angle less than a right angle.
</li>

<li>
XIII.<br>
A term or boundary is the extremity of any thing.
</li>

<li>
XIV.<br>
A figure is a surface enclosed on all sides by a line or lines.
</li>

<li>
XV.<br>
A circle is a plane figure, bounded by one continued line, called its circumference or
periphery; and having a certain point within it, from which all straight lines drawn
to its circumference are equal.
</li>

<li>
XVI.<br>
This point (from which the equal lines are drawn) is called the centre of the circle.
</li>

<li>
XVII.<br>
A diameter of a circle is a straight line drawn through the cente, terminated both ways
in the circumference.
</li>

<li>
XVIII.<br>
A semicircle is the figure contained by the diameter, and the part of the circle
cut off by the diameter.
</li>

<li>
XIX.<br>
A segment of a circle is a figure contained by a straight line, and the part of
the circumference which it cuts off.
</li>

<li>
XX.<br>
A figure contained by straight lines only, is called a rectilinear figure.
</li>

<li>
XXI.<br>
A triangle is a rectilinear figure included by three sides.
</li>

<li>
XXII.<br>
A quadrilateral figure is one which is bounded by four sides. The straight
lines [BLUE LINE] and [RED LINE] connecting the vertices of the opposite
angles of a quadrilateral figure, are called its diagonals.
</li>

<li>
XXIII.<br>
A polygon is a rectilinear figure bounded by more than four sides.
</li>

<li>
XXIV.<br>
A triangle whose three sides are equal is said to be equilateral.
</li>

<li>
XXV.<br>
A triangle which has only two sides equal is called an isosceles triangle.
</li>

<li>
XXVI.<br>
A scalene triangle is one which has no two sides equal.
</li>

<li>
XXVII.<br>
A right angled triangle is that which has a right angle.
</li>

<li>
XXVIII.<br>
An obtuse angled triangle is that which has an obtuse angle.
</li>

<li>
XXIX.<br>
An acute angled triangle is that which has three acute angles.
</li>

<li>
XXX.<br>
Of four-sided figures, a square is that which has all its sides equal,
and all its angles right angles.
</li>

<li>
XXXI.<br>
A rhombus is that which has all its sides equal, but its angles are not
right angles.
</li>

<li>
XXXII.<br>
An oblong is that which has all its angles right angles, but has not all
its sides equal.
</li>

<li>
XXXIII.<br>
A rhomboid is that which has its opposite sides equal to one another,
but all its sides are not equal, nor its angles right angles.
</li>

<li>
XXXIV.<br>
All other quadrilateral figures are called trapeziums.
</li>

<li>
XXXV.<br>
Parallel straight lines are such as are in the same plane, and which
being produced continually in both directions would never meet.
</li>
</ul>
